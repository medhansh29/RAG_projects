Aerodynamics is the study of the motion of air, particularly when it interacts with a solid object like an aircraft wing. It is a fundamental branch of fluid dynamics and plays a critical role in the design and performance of vehicles moving through the atmosphere.

The four primary aerodynamic forces acting on an aircraft are lift, weight, thrust, and drag:
- Lift is the upward force that counteracts the weight of the aircraft and is generated by the wings.
- Weight is the force due to gravity pulling the aircraft downward.
- Thrust is the forward force produced by engines to overcome drag.
- Drag is the resistive force that opposes the aircraft’s motion through the air.

Lift is primarily governed by Bernoulli’s Principle and Newton’s Third Law. Faster airflow over the curved top surface of a wing creates lower pressure, generating lift.

Drag can be divided into two major types:
1. Parasite Drag – caused by the shape of the aircraft and surface friction.
2. Induced Drag – a byproduct of lift, especially prominent at low speeds and high angles of attack.

The angle of attack (AoA) is the angle between the chord line of the wing and the oncoming airflow. Increasing AoA increases lift up to a point, beyond which the wing stalls and lift drops sharply.

Reynolds number is a dimensionless value that predicts flow patterns in different fluid flow situations. In aerodynamics, it helps determine whether the flow is laminar or turbulent, which affects drag and stability.

Supersonic and hypersonic aerodynamics deal with speeds greater than the speed of sound (Mach 1). These regimes require special considerations due to shock waves, compressibility effects, and high-temperature airflow interactions.

Understanding and optimizing aerodynamic forces are essential for efficient flight, improved fuel economy, and enhanced safety in aircraft, automobiles, and even sports equipment.
